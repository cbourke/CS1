This is the latex source and other artifacts for my *Computer Science I* textbook which
covers CS1 topics by presenting them in abstract manner using pseudocode (part I).  
Subsequent parts of the book reiterate these topics in a particular programming language.
Currently, parts are available for C, Java, and PHP.
