%%Chapter: Objects in Java

Java is a class-based object oriented programming language, meaning
that it facilitates the creation of objects through the use of classes.
Classes are essentially ``blueprints'' for creating instances of 
objects.  We've been implicitly using classes all along since everything
in Java must be a class or belong to a class.  Now, however, we will
start using classes in more depth rather than simply using static 
methods.
