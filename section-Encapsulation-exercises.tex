\section{Exercises}

\begin{exer}
A \emph{complex} number consists of two real numbers: a real
component $a$ and an imaginary component $bi$ where
$i - \sqrt{-1}$.  Define an object or structure to model a
complex number.  Write functions to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Create a complex number
  \item Print a complex number
  \item Perform basic arithmetic operations on two complex
  	numbers including addition, subtraction and multiplication 
	as defined by:
	$$c_1 + c_2 = (a_1 + b_1i) + (a_2 + b_1i) = (a_1+a_2) + (b_1+b_2)i$$
	$$c_1 - c_2 = (a_1 + b_1i) - (a_2 + b_1i) = (a_1-a_2) + (b_1-b_2)i$$
	$$c_1 \cdot c_2 = (a_1 + b_1i) \cdot (a_2 + b_1i) = 
	  (a_1a_1-b_1b_2) + (a_1b_2+b_1a_1)i$$
\end{itemize}

\begin{exer}
Design an object (or structure) that models an album.  Include
at least the album title, artist (or band) and release year.
Include any other data that you think is relevant and write
functions to support your object.
