Revise Introduction:
 Include a section on programming language paradigms, Procedural, Functional, Object Oriented, etc.

Analogies:
 Periods end sentences -> semicolons end executable lines
 Paragraphs are separated by lines -> blocks are demarcated with curly brackets
 Shakespearian plays are annotated: lines needing more explanation have
  footnotes; but not all lines need explaining -> comments should be used
  to document important or unclear things; code itself should be self-documenting

Add a quote:
 Because of the low-level nature of C, you can really get yourself
 in trouble and the language will let you.  In contrast, some language
 C is the kind of language that if you tell it you want to shoot
 yourself in the foot, it will ask you ``what caliber’’?   
 In contrast, some more ``managed'' languages will ask you, are you
 really sure you want to do that?

Under comments section add a reference to ``doc style’’ comments
and description

Ryan:
I'm just getting to look at this now.

-I like Figure 2.1 (I present loops and conditionals using similar diagramming), but it's probably better to differentiate control nodes and action nodes in a way that would be unambiguous if someone printed the text in black and white. Could you change the shape or texture of one of them to clarify which is which?
-It doesn't look like you define that you are using // to start comments until 15.2.3, but you start using them in 2.2.4


C: malloc:

issues like this can invoke holy wars

to cast or not to cast?

not necessary in pure C

will do it:
clarity and intent is more important than brevity
more importantly: its necessary in C++, doing so allows you to use either compiler
