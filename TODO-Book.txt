Analogies:
 Periods end sentences -> semicolons end executable lines
 Paragraphs are separated by lines -> blocks are demarcated with curly brackets
 Shakespearian plays are annotated: lines needing more explanation have
  footnotes; but not all lines need explaining -> comments should be used
  to document important or unclear things; code itself should be self-documenting

Add a quote:
 Because of the low-level nature of C, you can really get yourself
 in trouble and the language will let you.  In contrast, some language
 C is the kind of language that if you tell it you want to shoot
 yourself in the foot, it will ask you ``what caliber’’?   
 In contrast, some more ``managed'' languages will ask you, are you
 really sure you want to do that?

C: malloc:

issues like this can invoke holy wars

to cast or not to cast?

not necessary in pure C

will do it:
clarity and intent is more important than brevity
more importantly: its necessary in C++, doing so allows you to use either compiler

C: arrays
Variable Length Array (VLA) introduced in C99 (and supported in GNU C89), but 
must take care with the stack to ensure it is not too big; moreover it is not
supported by any C++ standard and should be avoided



%MOVE THIS TO STRUCTS/CLASSES?
%C allows you to define several \emph{user defined types}.  User defined
%types are types in addition to the built-in primitive types of a language 
%such as \mintinline{c}{int}, \mintinline{c}{double}, etc.  C was designed
%to be \emph{extensible} in that you can add your own types if necessary.
%After all, computer programs are intended to model the real world and
%not everything in the real world is conceptually a number.  By using
%user defined types, we can more closely model the real world.
