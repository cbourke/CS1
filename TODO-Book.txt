Add a quote:
 Because of the low-level nature of C, you can really get yourself
 in trouble and the language will let you.  In contrast, some language
 C is the kind of language that if you tell it you want to shoot
 yourself in the foot, it will ask you ``what caliber’’?   
 In contrast, some more ``managed'' languages will ask you, are you
 really sure you want to do that?
